Welcome to the Angular Boot Camp Curriculum. This repository
contains much of the example code we use in teaching
[Angular Boot Camp](https://angularbootcamp.com/),
available here to use in class, or for developers everywhere to refer
for (hopefully) high quality examples of specific Angular topics.

Some of the examples have explanation inline, but of course we provide
extensive explanation during Angular Boot Camp.

## Command Line Scripts Usage

To figure out the name to use in the below command line snippets, you can
simply copy everything before the first `-` of the example app's directory.

For example: `abc-101-data-binding` would be `abc-101`.

> For `abc-###` specific steps (not `rxjs`, `ngrx`, etc...) you can shorten the
name even further.
For example: `abc-101` would be simplified to `101`.

### Running an example

```bash
npm run serve abc-101
```

### Running the unit tests for an example

```bash
npm run test abc-722
```

### Building an example

```bash
npm run build rxjs-600
```
