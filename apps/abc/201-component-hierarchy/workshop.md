# Workshop for this step

Goals:

* Add a new lazy loaded feature.
* Add several new components.
* Set up initial routing.

-----

1. Use the Angular CLI to create the dashboard component.
   The command below will generate the dashboard component using 
   the standalone option by default.

```
ng generate component dashboard
```

(On StackBlitz, right-click the app folder and choose to generate a
new component. Enter "dashboard" at the prompt.)

2. Generate all the nested components to put inside the dashboard.
Add the 'dashboard/' prefix, so they are added in the right structure.

For example, your commands may look something like this:

```
ng generate component dashboard/videoList
ng generate component dashboard/videoPlayer
ng generate component dashboard/statFilters
```

(The stat graphs component will be added later, time permitting.)

(On StackBlitz, right-click the dashboard folder and choose to
generate each new component. Enter "videoList" or
"video-list" at the prompt.)

3. Set up routing.

Add a route to the dashboard component, using lazy loading.

4. Assemble your static application.

Use the components you generated in step 2 to reconstruct the video
stat tracker app in the dashboard component. As you begin, of course,
the components will be placeholders without actual functionality.
