# Workshop for this step

To get started there should be two items in the application store:
The video list and the selected video

1. Add the appropriate ngrx dependencies
2. Create a reducer that manages the video list and selected video
3. Provide the reducer to your application main.ts
4. Use the ngrx store as the data source for the list component and selected video information
5. Emit changes to the list or selected videos to the store
6. (OPTIONAL - see instructor for details) Add the stat graphs component
