# Workshop for this step

We will write test from outside the store that mock the store.

Use `author-list.component.spec.ts`, `article-list.component.spec.
ts`, and `article.component.spec.ts` for examples.

Run `npm run test ngrx-201` to execute the tests.

1. Add tests to `app.component.spec.ts` for `title` .
2. Add tests to `author.component.spec.ts` for `articles$` and 
   `author$`.
